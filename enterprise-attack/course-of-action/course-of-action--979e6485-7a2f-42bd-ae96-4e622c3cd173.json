Limit the permissions for accounts that are at higher risk of compromise; for example, configure SSH so users can only run specific programs. Prevent Credential Access techniques that may allow an adversary to acquire [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) that can be used by existing services.",
