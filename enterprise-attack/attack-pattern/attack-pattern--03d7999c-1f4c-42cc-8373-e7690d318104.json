They may do this, for example, by retrieving account usernames or by using Credential Dumping Mitigation. The information may be collected in a number of different ways using other Discovery techniques, because user and username details are prevalent throughout a system and include running process ownership, file/directory ownership, session information, and system logs.\n\n===Mac===\n\nOn Mac, the currently logged in user can be identified with <code>users</code>,<code>w</code>, and <code>who</code>.\n\n===Linux===\n\nOn Linux, the currently logged in user can be identified with <code>w</code> and <code>who</code>.",
